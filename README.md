# Scope of the Project


## Site Description

Ola Fresco(OF) is a website that offers a wide variety of dishes to the user. OF acts as a middle-man between the user and the restaurants that OF gets their dishes from. OF aims to make the food ordering experience as convenient as possible by allowing users to filter the dishes by food type and potentially allergenic ingredients; users may then save this information for later. After ordering a dish, the user will be given the option to leave a rating that will be displayed in their Order History. 

## As a client you can:
 * Select the products that I need and add them to my ‘cart’.
 * Filter the products by category and allergies.
 * Login or register before / during / after adding items to my cart without losing my selection..
 * Select a delivery address (current location of custom)
 * Select a method of payment.
 * See if the company offers jobs.
 * See more info about the company.
 * See if the company has social medias
 * Save my food / restaurant preferences.
 * Enter a Promo code for discounts
 * Leave a rating for restaurants I order from.
 
 ## As an administrator I can:
 * Add new dishes
 * Edit the name, description, tags and price of existing dishes.
 * Delete dishes or make them unavailable.
 * Contact users if need be (eg. if ingredients aren’t available) 
 * Cancel and refund orders
 * Manage Promo codes.
 * Edit info about the company.
 * Edit social media links.
